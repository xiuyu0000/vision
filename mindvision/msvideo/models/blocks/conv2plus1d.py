    """R(2+1)d conv12 block. It implements spatial-temporal feature extraction in
        a sperated way.

    Args:
        in_channels (int):  The number of channels of input frame images.
        out_channels (int):  The number of channels of output frame images.
        kernel_size (tuple): The size of the spatial-temporal convolutional layer kernels.
        stride (Union[int, Tuple[int]]): Stride size for the convolutional layer. Default: 1.
        group (int): Splits filter into groups, in_channels and out_channels must be divisible by the number
            of groups. Default: 1.
        norm (Optional[nn.Cell]): Norm layer that will be stacked on top of the convolution
            layer. Default: nn.BatchNorm3d.
        activation (Optional[nn.Cell]): Activation function which will be stacked on top of the
            normalization layer (if not None), otherwise on top of the conv layer. Default: nn.ReLU.

    Returns:
        Tensor, its channel size is calculated from in_channel, out_channel and kernel_size.
