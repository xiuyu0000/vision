    TODO: introduction i3d network.

    Args:
        in_channel(int): Number of channel of input data. Default: 3.
        num_classes(int): Number of classes, it is the size of classfication score for every sample,
            i.e. :math:`CLASSES_{out}`. Default: 400.
        keep_prob(float): Probability of dropout for multi-dense-layer head, the number of probabilities equals
            the number of dense layers. Default: 0.5.
        pooling_keep_dim: whether to keep dim when pooling. Default: True.
        pretrained(bool): If `True`, it will create a pretrained model, the pretrained model will be loaded
            from network. If `False`, it will create a i3d model with uniform initialization for weight and bias. Default: False.

    Inputs:
        - **x** (Tensor) - Tensor of shape :math:`(N, C_{in}, D_{in}, H_{in}, W_{in})`.

    Outputs:
        Tensor of shape :math:`(N, CLASSES_{out})`.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``GPU``

    Examples:
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> import mindspore as ms
        >>> from mindvision.msvideo.models import i3d
        >>>
        >>> net = i3d()
        >>> x = ms.Tensor(np.ones([1, 3, 32, 224, 224]), ms.float32)
        >>> output = net(x)
        >>> print(output.shape)
