## Introduction

MindSpor Video(msvideio) is an open source Video toolbox based on MindSpore.

## Major features

- Modular Design

We decompose the video framework into different components and one can easily construct a customized video framework by combining different modules.

### Supported models

- [x] [C3D]() for Action Recognition.
- [x] [I3D]() for Action Recognition.
- [x] [X3D]() for Action Recognition.
- [x] [R(2+1)d]() for Action Recognition.
- [x] [NonLocal]() for Action Recognition.
- [x] [ViST]() for Action Recognition.
- [x] [fairMOT]() for One-shot Tracking.
- [x] [VisTR]() for Instance Segmentation.
- [x] [ARN]() for Few-shot Action Recognition.
