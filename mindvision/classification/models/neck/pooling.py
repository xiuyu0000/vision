    Applies a 1D/2D average pooling over an input Tensor.

    Args:
        dim (int) : The dimension of the pooling kernel.
        kernel_size (Union[int, tuple[int]]): The size of kernel used to take the average value.
            The data type of kernel_size must be int and the value represents the height and width,
            or a tuple of two int numbers that represent height and width respectively.
            Default: 1.
        stride (Union[int, tuple[int]]): The distance of kernel moving, an int number that represents
            the height and width of movement are both strides, or a tuple of two int numbers that
            represent height and width of movement respectively. Default: 1.
        pad_mode (str): The optional value for pad mode, is "same" or "valid", not case sensitive.
            Default: "valid".

            - same: Adopts the way of completion. The height and width of the output will be the same as
              the input. The total number of padding will be calculated in horizontal and vertical
              directions and evenly distributed to top and bottom, left and right if possible.
              Otherwise, the last extra padding will be done from the bottom and the right side.

            - valid: Adopts the way of discarding. The possible largest height and width of output
              will be returned without padding. Extra pixels will be discarded.

    Returns:
        Tensor, output tensor.
