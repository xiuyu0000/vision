    Constructs a PointnetNet2 architecture from
    PointnetNet2: Deep Hierarchical Feature Learning on Point Sets in a Metric Space <https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02413>.

    Args:
        normal_channel (bool): Whether to use the channels of points' normal vector. Default: True.
        pretrained (bool): If True, returns a model pre-trained on IMAGENET. Default: False.

    Inputs:
        - points(Tensor) - Tensor of original points. shape:[batch, channels, npoints].

    Outputs:
        Tensor of shape :[batch, 40].

    Supported Platforms:
        ``GPU``

    Examples:
        >> import numpy as np
        >> import mindspore as ms
        >> from mindspore import Tensor, context
        >> from mindvision.ms3d.models.backbones import pointnet2cls
        >> context.set_context(mode=context.GRAPH_MODE, device_target="GPU", save_graphs=False, max_call_depth=2000)
        >> net = Pointnet2clsModel(normal_channel=True, pretrained:bool=False)
        >> xyz = Tensor(np.ones((24,6, 1024)),ms.float32)
        >> output = net(xyz)
        >> print(output.shape)
        (24, 40)

    About PointNet2Cls:

    This architecture is based on PointNet2 classfication SSG,
    compared with PointNet, PointNet2_SSG added local feature extraction.
