class CrossEntropySmooth(LossBase):
    """
    Computes softmax cross entropy between digits and labels with label smoothing.

    Measures the distribution error between the probabilities of the input (computed with softmax function) and the
    target where the classes are mutually exclusive using cross entropy loss.

    In order to avoid nan loss in training, smoothing is applied to label.

    Typical input into this function is unnormalized scores denoted as x whose shape is (N, C),
    and the corresponding targets.

    Args:
        classes_num: Number of classes.
        sparse (bool): Specifies whether labels use sparse format or not. Default: False.
        reduction (str): Type of reduction to be applied to loss. The optional values are "mean", "sum", and "none".
            If "none", do not perform reduction. Default: "none".
        smooth_factor: Smoothing the label to avoid nan loss. Default: 0.0.

    Inputs:
        - **logits** (Tensor) - Tensor of shape (N, C). Data type must be float16 or float32.
        - **labels** (Tensor) - Tensor of shape (N, ). If `sparse` is True, The type of
          `labels` is int32 or int64. If `sparse` is False, the type of `labels` is the same as the type of `logits`.

    Outputs:
        Tensor, a tensor of the same shape and type as logits with the component-wise logistic losses.
